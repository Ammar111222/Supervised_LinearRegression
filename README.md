Problem

A leading global leader of e-commerce has over 150 million paid subscription users. One of the many perks of the subscription is the privilege of buying products at lower prices. For an upcoming sale, the organization has decided to promote local artisans and their products, to help them through these tough times. However, slashed prices may impact local artists. To not let discounts affect local artists, the company has decided to determine the lowest price at which a particular good can be sold. Your task is to build a predictive model using Machine Learning that helps them set up a lowest-pricing model for these products. You have to predict the Low_Cap_Price column.

Q1.Describe the problem in your own words?

Ans: The problem is that I have to build a model that helps to determine the lowest price at which a particular good can be sold.Like to predict the Low_Cap_Price column.

Q2.Explain how linear regression can help solve this problem?

Ans: When we plot the graph with the input features and the target variable i.e lowest prize,we will see a sort of linear line and Linear Regression is the simplest algorithms in Machine learning for predictive modeling.Linear regression can help solve this problem by finding a linear relationship between the input features (such as date, market category, product category, grade, and demand) and the target variable (lowest price).Then we train the model which then allows the model to predict the lowest price for new instances based on their feature values,
